# ISY503 Intelligent Systems - Project

This project involves training a neural network to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of labeled product reviews, classifying them as positive or negative. The trained model is integrated into a web application for real-time sentiment analysis using FastAPI for the backend and a simple JavaScript page for entering reviews and displaying results.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergey-chek/sentiment-analysis-isy503.git
```
```bash
cd sentiment-analysis-isy503
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
In some cases it could be 
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment:
**- Windows:**
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
**- MacOS and Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Web Application

### 1. Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

The following command will start the FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by default.
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you use a different port for the server, make sure to update the `API_ENDPOINT` variable in `static/script.js` to match the correct port.

### 2. Access the frontend

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (or to your custom endpoint).

## Building Model
1. Ensure that the training data files are placed in the `model/import-labeled-data` folder.
2. To prepare a combined .csv file and perform spelling correction, run the `model.prepare` module using command:
```bash
python3 -m model.prepare
```
3. For subsequent data cleaning, run the `model.clean` module using command:
```bash
python3 -m model.clean
```
4. For model training, run the `model.train` module using command:
```bash
python3 -m model.train
```
The trained model will be saved in the `model/trained-model` directory.
